    Throughout my studies, I have came across and participated in some challenging Software Engineering projects. The two projects I did in CS2103 Software Engineering
    are a green field individual project, <a href="https://github.com/geetengtan/BMO-Assistant">BMO Assistant</a> and a brown field team project, 
    <a href="https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-1/tp">TAddressBook</a>. Both projects are done in mostly Java,

    BMO Asssistant is an application used to help user keep track of tasks, deadlines and events. This <a href="https://github.com/geetengtan/BMO-Assistant">link</a> 
    directs to the Github repo of BMO Assistant and there contains the user guide and installation guide.

    TAddressBook is a desktop application created with the aim of helping CS2030S Teaching Assistants (TAs) keep track of student's lab assignments. It is CLI application
    and is optimized for user that can type fast. Detailed documentation of the product can be found <a href="https://ay2122s2-cs2103-f10-1.github.io/tp/">here</a> and the
