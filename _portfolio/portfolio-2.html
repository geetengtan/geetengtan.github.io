    I did my industrial attachment or internship in <a href="https://www.skymech.com.sg/">Skymech Automation & Engineering</a>. 
    Skymech specialises in designing customized products using <strong>automated machines</strong> and <strong>robotic integration</strong>. 
    During my time there, I mainly did 3D CAD designs and 2D part drawings.

<P>
    One of my main projects during my time in Skymech is to design a portion of a large Packaging and Assembly Machine. 
    The designs made in Skymech are confidential and not much images can be shared but I managed to get approval on some of them. 
    The part that I designed for the Packaging and Assembly Machine consist of various components such as the Labelling Machine, Taping Machine, Conveyor Belts and a Universal Robot.
