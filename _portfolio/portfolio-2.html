    I did my industrial attachment or internship in <a href="https://www.skymech.com.sg/">Skymech Automation & Engineering</a>. 
    Skymech specialises in designing customized products using <strong>automated machines</strong> and <strong>robotic integration</strong>. 
    During my time there, I mainly did 3D CAD designs and 2D part drawings. The designs made in Skymech are confidential and not much images 
    can be shared but I managed to get approval on some of them. Images shown are designs done by myself from scratch under guidance from my
    supervisor.

    One of my main projects during my time in Skymech is to design a portion of a large <strong>Packaging and Assembly Machine</strong>. The part that I designed 
    for the Packaging and Assembly Machine consist of various components such as the Labelling Machine, Taping Machine, Conveyor Belts and a 
    Universal Robot. I was given the opportunity to work together with engineers from different disciplines such as electrical engineers that are 
    in charge of the wiring and actuation components of the project, and software engineers that are programming the robots used.

    Another project that I worked on was a <strong>Vision Inspection Machine</strong>. For this project, the machine aims to sample a production line to perform 
    vision inspections. I worked on the project from scratch, starting from the preliminary design, to liasing with clients, sourcing for 
    equipments and finalising the design. I was given the rare opportunity to design a project on my own as an intern and I believe that led me
    to better confidence in my designs and greater understanding in the considerations made when designing a machine.
