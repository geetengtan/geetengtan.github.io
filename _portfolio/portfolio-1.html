Rock n Roll Wheelchair started out as a design project from school. 
The aim of the project is to familiarise students with industrial mechanical design requirements. 
However, my project group exceeded expectations and managed to further extend our project into the Assistive and Rehabilitation Technologies Student Innovation Challenge (ARTSIC). 
My team improved the wheelchair design and was awarded a BRONZE MDEAL for Design Category of the competition.
